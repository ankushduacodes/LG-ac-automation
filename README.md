I automated temperature regulation and on off functionality in my thinq compatible Air Conditioner using third party API named wideq(https://github.com/sampsyo/wideq) 
by Adrian Sampsyo(https://github.com/sampsyo)

`pip install wideq` if you dont care about jet mode

I make use of jet mode functionality in `config_ac.py` script which was contributed by me but is yet to be released by author, so to use jet mode functionality please make sure that you are building wideq package locally. if you want a script that doesnot make use if jet mode let me know by creating an issue
